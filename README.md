# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict **loan approval status** using different **Machine Learning algorithms**.  
It involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and ML model building**.  

We test multiple algorithms including **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and SVC **.  
The best performance was achieved with **Random Forest (100% accuracy)**.

## 📊 Dataset  
- Contains applicant details like income, loan amount, credit history, gender, marital status, etc.  
- Target variable: **Loan_Status** (Y/N).  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Checked for missing values and handled them.  
- Visualized distributions of **ApplicantIncome**, **LoanAmount**, etc.  
- Compared loan approval with factors like **Credit History, Gender, Education, Employment Type**.
